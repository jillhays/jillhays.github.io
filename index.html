				Hello! My name is Gillian Hays. I am a 28 year old graphic design student at the University of Central Florida. 
				Before I began pursuing my degree, I spent three years in Los Angeles working as a freelance production designer for independent films. 
				My time in the film industry was extremely valuable to my growth as an artist. I am excited now to start my next chapter of artistic pursuits in the world of graphic design.

				Although I no longer work in film, I still have a love for art forms that tell a narrative. 
				Through my studies of graphic design, I've learned to channel my work into something more commercially focused, such as branding and logos. 
				I have recently found a new passion that blends these art forms, through the use of motion graphics. I would love to find a career in that line of work.
